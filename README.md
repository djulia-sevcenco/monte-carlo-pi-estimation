This is a beginner Monte Carlo Pi Estimation.
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of Pi. The Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that allows for solving mathematical problems using random sampling.

## Description

The script generates random points within a unit square and checks how many of them fall inside a quarter circle. By using the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points, it estimates the value of Pi. The script also plots the points and the quarter circle to visualize the process.

## Installation

To run this script, you'll need Python 3 installed on your system along with the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
